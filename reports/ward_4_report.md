## Background

MPD recently made its annual public release of Adult Arrests data, covering 19,263 arrests in 2024. This data represents the first full year of data available since Chief Smith took office in November of 2023, and reveals major changes in policing strategy over that timeframe. This report begins with an overview of citywide trends, and then explores the data specific to Ward 4.

This adult arrest data is taken from the Open Data DC website. DC resident and data scientist Taylor Terry maintains an archive of this and other DC public data at https://github.com/taylorterry3/dc-public-data. A complete index of these reports for each Ward is available at http://bit.ly/4iG0Uht. Taylor can be reached at taylor.terry@gmail.com.
