# Ward 8 MPD Adult Arrest Trends, 2023-2024

## Background

MPD recently made its annual public release of adult arrest data, covering 19,263 arrests in 2024. This data represents the first full year of data available since Chief Smith took office in November of 2023, and reveals major changes in policing strategy over that timeframe. This report begins with an overview of citywide trends, and then explores the data specific to Ward 8.

This adult arrest data is taken from the Open Data DC website. DC resident and data scientist Taylor Terry maintains an archive of this and other DC public data at https://github.com/taylorterry3/dc-public-data. A complete index of these reports for each Ward is available at http://bit.ly/4iG0Uht. Taylor can be reached at taylor.terry@gmail.com.

### Productivity per Officer

MPD reported having 3,282 sworn officers in 2024, meaning that 19,263 arrests represents 5.9 arrests per sworn officer for the year. This is a substantial increase from the 2021-2023 average of 4.3 arrests per officer per year, but is far from a return to the 2016-2019 average of 7.7 arrests per officer. The chart below shows the trend in arrests per sworn officer over time, as well as the trend in stops per officer for periods when this data is available. (MPD stops data currently runs only through June of 2024, and the release schedule is irregular.)
