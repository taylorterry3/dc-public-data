# DC Metropolitan Police Department Adult Arrest Trends, 2023-2024

## Background

MPD recently made its annual public release of adult arrest data, covering 19,263 arrests in 2024. This data represents the first full year of data available since Chief Smith took office in November of 2023, and reveals major changes in policing strategy over that timeframe. This report covers data for the entire city, and also includes an appendix with tables and charts for each Ward and Police District. 

This adult arrest data is taken from the Open Data DC website. DC resident and data scientist Taylor Terry maintains an archive of this and other DC public data at https://github.com/taylorterry3/dc-public-data. Taylor can be reached at taylor.terry@gmail.com.


### Citywide Changes in Arrest Patterns

in 2024 MPD made19,263 adult arrests citywide, a +27% change from 15,223 arrests in 2023 and a +30% change from the 2021-2023 average of 14,861. The increase in arrests was concentrated in Wards 1, 7, and 8. These wards each saw more than 1,000 additional arrests, while the next biggest gain was 212 additional arrests in Ward 5.

| Ward | 2023 | 2024 | Change | Percent Change |
|------|------:|------:|--------:|---------------:|
| 1 | 1,699 | 2,820 | +1,121 | +66% |
| 2 | 1,790 | 1,916 | +126 | +7% |

| 7 | 2,798 | 4,017 | +1,219 | +44% |
| 8 | 3,359 | 4,388 | +1,029 | +31% |

Much of this increase in arrests was driven by 2,000 additional arrests for Traffic Violations, 868 more for Theft, 814 more for Narcotics, and 743 more for Liquor Law Violations. 

| Arrest Category | 2023 | 2024 | Change | % Change |

| Traffic Violations | 898 | 2,898 | +2,000 | +223% |

This crosstab shows the percentage change for these arrest categories by Ward from 2023 to 2024. Note especially the roughly tenfold increase in Liquor Law Violation arrests in Wards 7 and 8, as well as a similarly large increase in Traffic Violation arrests in Ward 7. Ward 1 saw fivefold increases in Liquor Law Violation and Narcotics arrests, while Ward 5 saw a similar rate of increase in Liquor Law Violation Arrests. 

|Category| W1 | W2 | W3 | W4 | W5 | W6 | W7 | W8 |
|--------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|----:|
| Traffic | +108% | +45% | +106% | +80% | +129% | +137% | +1047% | +211% |

### Productivity per Officer

MPD reported having 3,282 sworn officers in 2024, meaning that 19,263 arrests represents 5.9 arrests per sworn officer for the year. This is a substantial increase from the 2021-2023 average of 4.3 arrests per officer per year, but is far from a return to the 2016-2019 average of 7.7 arrests per officer. 

The chart below shows the trend in arrests per sworn officer per monthover time, as well as the trend in stops per officer for periods when this data is available. MPD stops data currently runs only from 2019 through June of 2024. The release schedule is irregular and MPD has historically refused to release this data in response to FOIA requests, and so it is unclear when the rest of the 2024 data will be available.
