:Crime is Up, Policing is Down: Crime Rates, Underreporting, and Policing in DC
---

## Executive Summary

While the crime rate in Washington, DC, appears to be flat, a more detailed examination of the data shows that this is likely caused by increased underreporting rather than an actual decline in crime. Crimes like homicide and auto theft where the reporting rate is known to be relatively invariant are up, while types of crime where the reporting rate varies with the rate of police action are flat or down. This explanation is supported by policing data, which shows that while police staffing is down about 10% from 2019 the rate of stops and arrests is off about 50%. The main policy implication of this finding is that improving the level of service provided by the current police force should be a higher prioirity for MPD, the Council, and the Mayor than inceasing police staffing.

## Introduction: Crime Statistics in Washington, DC

Crime rates in Washington, DC, have declined massively since the early 1990's,  2017-2019. {need charts here, get older incident data or just use FBI}. However, the statistics are less clear in the period since the start of 2020. The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic altered patterns of both general social behavior and policing practices, and these events were followed closely by widespread protests in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the passage of the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Act in the summer of 2020. Topline crime rates have appeared to stay low since 2020, with total .... and violent crime .... {charts or whatever}. However, the last three years have seen substantial increases in certain types of crime, most notably homicides and car theft. {chart}

While rates of different types of crime do not historically rise and fall in lockstep with one another, it is difficult to tell a coherent causal story for why homicide would rise while assuault with a dangerous weapon (ADW) stays flat, or why car theft would see a massive spike while other forms of theft and burglary have seen little movement.

## Relative Reporting Rates Across Different Types of Crime

A more likely cause of this uneven rise in crime rates is differential changes in rates of reporting and recording of different types of crime. Homicide and car theft are known in the criminology literature to have consistently very high reporting rates (see Baumer 2010), for intuitive reasons. Homicides generate a body or at least a permanently missing person, and trigger administrative processes around death certificates and transfer of assets to heirs. Similarly, the theft of a vehicle is much more likely to trigger a report than other types of property because of the incentives created by insurance, loans, and government registration.
