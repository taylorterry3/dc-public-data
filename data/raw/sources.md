Adult_Arrests.csv: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/adult-arrests/explore
Crime_Incidents_in 20**.csv: https://opendata.dc.gov/search?collection=Dataset&q=crime%20incidents&sort=-created. 2023 data is only through Jan 26 so I have not bothered with it.
dc-crimes-search-results.csv.gz: https://crimecards.dc.gov/all:crimes/all:weapons/8:years/citywide:ward. More up to date than annual incident data, goes back 8 years.
Juvenile_Arrests.csv: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/juvenile-arrests/explore
Stop_Data.csv: https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/stop-data/explore
